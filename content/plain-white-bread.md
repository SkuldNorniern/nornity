There's something comforting about the smell of fresh bread baking in the oven. This simple white bread recipe produces a soft, fluffy loaf that's perfect for sandwiches, toast, or simply enjoying with butter. With just a few basic ingredients and some patience, you can create bakery-quality bread at home.

## Why Make Your Own Bread?

Homemade bread offers several advantages:
- **Freshness**: Nothing beats bread straight from the oven
- **Control**: You know exactly what ingredients go into your bread
- **Cost-effective**: Much cheaper than artisanal bakery bread
- **Satisfaction**: The sense of accomplishment from creating something from scratch

## Ingredients

### For 1 Loaf (approximately 800g):

- **350g strong bread flour** (high protein content for good structure)
- **120g water** (room temperature)
- **5g instant yeast** (or 7g active dry yeast)
- **110g milk** (room temperature, whole milk preferred)
- **30g butter** (softened, unsalted)
- **5g salt** (fine table salt)
- **35g sugar** (granulated white sugar)

**Note**: Strong bread flour (12-14% protein) is essential for proper gluten development and structure.

## Equipment Needed

- **Digital scale** (for precise measurements)
- **Large mixing bowl**
- **Stand mixer with dough hook** (optional, but helpful)
- **Long loaf pan** (13x4 inch or similar for three rolls)
- **Plastic wrap** or damp towel

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Preparing the Ingredients

```bash
# Before starting:
1. Bring milk and water to room temperature
2. Soften butter (not melted, just soft)
3. Measure all ingredients precisely
4. Grease your long loaf pan
```

### 2. Mixing the Dough

**Method 1: Stand Mixer**
1. Mix yeast with water in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes
2. Combine flour, salt, and sugar in mixer bowl
3. Add the yeast-water mixture and mix on low speed
4. Gradually add milk while mixing
5. Add softened butter in small pieces
6. Mix on medium speed for 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic

**Method 2: Hand Mixing**
1. Mix yeast with water in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes
2. Combine flour, salt, and sugar in large bowl
3. Add the yeast-water mixture and stir
4. Gradually add milk while stirring
5. Add softened butter and knead by hand for 10-15 minutes
6. Dough should be smooth and slightly sticky

### 3. First Rise (Bulk Fermentation)

- Place dough in lightly oiled bowl
- Cover with plastic wrap or damp towel
- **Create a warm environment**: Place a cup of warm water next to the dough bowl
- Let rise in a warm spot (24-27°C / 75-80°F) for 1-1.5 hours
- Dough should double in size

### 4. Shaping the Loaf

1. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface
2. Gently deflate and divide dough into **three equal portions** (about 260g each)
3. Shape each portion into a smooth ball
4. Let rest for 10 minutes (bench rest)
5. **For each portion:**
   - Roll out into a rectangle, about 6x4 inches
   - Fold the top third down to center
   - Fold the bottom third up to center
   - Pinch the seam closed
   - Roll into a cylinder, about 4-5 inches long
6. Place all three rolls **side by side** in the greased long loaf pan
7. Ensure even spacing between the rolls

### 5. Second Rise (Final Proofing)

- Cover loaf pan with plastic wrap or damp towel
- Let rise in a warm spot for 45-60 minutes
- Rolls should rise to about 1 inch below the pan rim
- The three rolls should expand and touch each other

### 6. Baking
**Preheat oven to 170°C (340°F)**

1. Remove cover from loaf pan
2. Place in preheated oven
3. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown
4. Internal temperature should reach 88-93°C (190-200°F)
5. Remove from pan and cool on wire rack

## Tips for Success

### Temperature Control
- **Rising temperature**: 24-27°C (75-80°F) is ideal for rising
- **Warm environment**: Place a cup of warm water next to the dough for better rising
- **Liquid temperature**: Room temperature liquids help with consistent rising
- **Oven temperature**: Accurate oven temperature is crucial

### Timing Guidelines
- **First rise**: 1-1.5 hours (until doubled)
- **Second rise**: 45-60 minutes (until 1 inch below pan rim)
- **Baking time**: 30-35 minutes
- **Cooling time**: At least 1 hour before slicing

### Dough Consistency
- Dough should be slightly sticky but manageable
- If too sticky, add small amounts of flour
- If too dry, add small amounts of water

### Three-Roll Method Tips
- **Equal portions**: Use a scale to ensure all three rolls are the same weight
- **Even spacing**: Leave equal gaps between rolls for even baking
- **Uniform shape**: Roll each portion to the same length and thickness
- **Proper folding**: The fold-by-3 method creates better structure and texture
- **Touching rolls**: After rising, the rolls should expand to touch each other

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Dense Bread
**Causes**: Insufficient rising time, over-kneading, cold ingredients
**Solutions**: Extend rising time, reduce kneading, use room temperature ingredients

### Bread Doesn't Rise
**Causes**: Dead yeast, too much salt, cold environment
**Solutions**: Check yeast expiration, reduce salt, find warmer spot

### Tough Crust
**Causes**: Over-baking, too much flour during shaping
**Solutions**: Reduce baking time, use less flour when shaping

### Bread Collapses
**Causes**: Over-proofing, weak gluten development
**Solutions**: Reduce proofing time, improve kneading technique

### Uneven Rolls
**Causes**: Unequal dough portions, inconsistent shaping
**Solutions**: Weigh each portion, practice uniform rolling technique

## Variations

### Sweet White Bread
- Increase sugar to 50g
- Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Perfect for French toast or sweet sandwiches

### Herb Bread
- Add 2 tablespoons dried herbs (rosemary, thyme, oregano)
- Mix herbs with dry ingredients
- Great for savory sandwiches

### Whole Milk Bread
- Use only whole milk (no water)
- Results in richer, more tender crumb
- Adjust liquid amount as needed

## Storage and Serving

### Fresh Storage
- Store in paper bag for 2-3 days
- Avoid plastic bags (traps moisture)
- Reheat in 180°C oven for 5 minutes to restore freshness

### Freezing
- Wrap tightly in foil
- Freeze for up to 3 months
- Thaw at room temperature, then reheat

### Serving Suggestions
- **Fresh**: Best within 24 hours of baking
- **Toast**: Excellent for breakfast
- **Sandwiches**: Perfect texture for any filling
- **French toast**: Use day-old bread for best results
- **Individual rolls**: Can be separated for individual servings
